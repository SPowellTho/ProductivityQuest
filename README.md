# ProductivityQuest
A Simple HTML Game

#WHY

This game was a way of both practicing Javascript but also fully realizing an idea I wanted to do for a while. I always loved turn based games and sometime I want a quick, low-effort game to play in my free time. This game was the answer.

#WHAT

This folder has everything used to make the game, which includes the HTML, CSS, and javascript code. Additionally, it also contains the images used in the game. That's it! The game is pretty lightweight, requiring only a single webpage.

#HOW

The game was written in Notepad++. If you plan on editting these files, use any Text Editor you want. Feel free to make your own versions of this game, but selling them is not allowed.

Thank you for reading,
